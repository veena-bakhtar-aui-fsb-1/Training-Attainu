1. Take the given number
2. Multiple the given number by itself and store the result.
3. Display the result.

Look at the time of the day and tell whether it's time for breakfast, lunch or

5. Else display "Not Palindrome"

Find the 10th number of a fibonacci series(research about this)
1. Take two initial numbers as a and b, both with values a=0 and b=0
2. Keep a count, initially as count= 0
3. c = a + b (consider a new number c)
4. a = b
5. b = c
6. count = count + 1 (increase the count by 1)
7. Repeat steps 3 to 6 till the count is equal to 8 
(here count is checked with 8 because we initially had 2 starting numbers of the series)
8. Display the number in c (that is the 10th number of the series)
