Adding VARIABLES/CONDITIONS/LOOPS what will be used for each of the following steps.

Find the square of a given number
1. Take the given number                                         ===> VARIABLE
2. Multiple the given number by itself and store the result.     ===> VARIABLE
3. Display the result.

Look at the time of the day and tell whether it's time for breakfast, lunch or
dinner
1. Get the time of your system in 24hr format                            ===> VARIABLE
2. If the time is between 8 to 11 then display "Time for Breakfast"      ===> CONDITION
3. If the time is between 12 to 15 then display "Time for Lunch"         ===> CONDITION
4. If the time is between 20 to 22 then display "Time for Dinner"        ===> CONDITION
5. Else display "Nothing"                                                ===> CONDITION

Given a number, find whether the number is odd or even
1. Take the given number                                            ===> VARIABLE
2. Divide the given number by 2                                     
3. If the number is divisible by 2 then display "Even Number"       ===> CONDITION
4. Else display "Odd Number"                                        ===> CONDITION

Find out whether a given number or a string is palindrome(something that looks
the same reading straight or in reverse)
1. Take the given number / string                                       ===> VARIABLE
2. Reverse that number/string                                           ===> VARIABLE
3. Compare the given number/string with the reversed number/string      
4. If both the values same the display "Palindrome"                     ===> CONDITION
5. Else display "Not Palindrome"                                        ===> CONDITION

Find the 10th number of a fibonacci series(research about this)
1. Take two initial numbers as a and b, both with values a=0 and b=0                        ===> VARIABLE
2. Keep a count, initially as count= 0                                                      ===> VARIABLE
3. c = a + b (consider a new number c)                                                      ===> VARIABLE
4. a = b
5. b = c
6. count = count + 1 (increase the count by 1)
7. Repeat steps 3 to 6 till the count is equal to 8                                         ===> LOOP
(here count is checked with 8 because we initially had 2 starting numbers of the series)
8. Display the number in c (that is the 10th number of the series)
